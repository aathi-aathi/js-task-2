Difference between Document and window obect:

window Object:

The window object represents the browser window or tab.
It is the top-level object in the client-side JavaScript environment.
It contains properties and methods that are global to the entire browsing context.
Examples of window properties include location (information about the URL), navigator (information about the browser), and console (for debugging).
document Object:

The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser.
It is a property of the window object and provides access to the content and structure of the document.
It contains methods and properties for manipulating and interacting with the content of the current web page.
Examples of document properties include getElementById(), (retrieving an element by its ID), querySelector(), (selecting the first element that matches a CSS selector), and createElement() (creating a new HTML element).
